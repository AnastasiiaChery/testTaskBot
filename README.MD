# Techinal assignment Trade-BM.ai


You have to analyze and make a report for each user on relation **users**.


Each user who uses our software has to pay a commission depending on how much the user earned in a certain period of time.
In relation **trades** you can calculate Profit and Loss for each user, using **realizedPnl** column.
To calculate Company profit, you should get **comission_percent** for each user in **users** relation.

Also, the company offers its users a referral system to invite their friends and pay **5%** for each commission paid.
In relation **referrals**  you have to add a column **commission**, which will be mean: how much Company have to pay for this users.

The ultimate goal of the assignment, you have to send each user an invoice about the payment, taking into account the referral payments.
You have to create a Class, in which, input will be telegram bot **token**. The main method of this class - POST response to user account in Telegram.
- Token: **1578481362:AAGq61UVSjdhyhiMNhl7I0r38Q8akjZomxk**
- Bot: **@test1213e1231_bot**
- User id, for sending invoice: **389484326**
- Invoice example:
"–ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç –¥—Ä—É–≥.
  –í–º–µ—Å—Ç–µ –º—ã –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–ª–∏: Nüí∞.
  –ë–ª–∞–≥–æ–¥–∞—Ä–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –¥–ª—è –º–µ–Ω—è —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç K%, –∏–ª–∏ J$."
  

Also, admins want to see some stats in two cases: Tables and Graphs. 
You can use **Jupyter Notebook**. Or you can choose any other tool that you like. 
But the main criterion is the information *content* that you present and visualize.


## Requirements:
- Python 3
- Data Analysis tools
- Data Visualization tools


### Good luck!
